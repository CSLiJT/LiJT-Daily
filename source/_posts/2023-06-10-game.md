An introduction to game theory.
<!--more-->

## Games Theory
1. Game theory is a bag of analytical tools designed to help us understand the phenomena that we observe when decision-makers interact. 

## Games and Solutions
1. A game is a description of strategic interaction that includes the constraints on the actions that the players *can* take and the players' interests, but does not specify the actions that the players *do* take.
  1. strategic games: a model of a situation in which each player chooses his plan of action once and for all, and all players' decisions are made simultaneously
  1. extensive games: specify the possible orders of events; each player can consider his plan of action not only at the beginning of the game but also whenever he has to make a decision
    1. with perfect information: each player is fully informed about others' moves
    1. without perfect information: each player is not fully informed about others' moves
  1. coalitional games
1. A *player* is the basic entity of all game theoretic models. A player may be interpreted as an individual or as a group of individuals making a decision.
  1. individual players -> noncooperative
  1. groups of players -> cooperative
1. Mathematical notations
